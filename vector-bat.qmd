## Biology

Bats are the only mammals capable of true flight. 
Found on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, there are over 1400 
species of bats worldwide. 
Bat species exhibit enormous diversity, ranging in size from 2g to nearly 1.5kg. 
Most bat species eat either insects, fruit, or nector.

::: {.callout-note title="Fun fact"}
In addition to being the only mammals that can truly fly, and the unique sensory 
adaptations for echolocation, bats have several remarkable features. 
They live longer life-spans (up to 40 years!) than other species of a similar 
size and have enormous metabolic rates during flight. 
Fascinatingly, they carry a wide-range of human transmissible viruses, but 
rarely are affected clinically themselves. 
The unique immune and metabolic features that allow them to tolerate viruses 
and have marked longevity is an area of active research.

## Infectious diseases

### Rabies

Rabies virus causes fatal neurological disease in all mammalian species. 
Transmitted through infectious saliva (generally through a bite from an infected 
animal), the virus is distributed in wildlife reservoirs globally. 
Approximately 59,000 humans die annually from rabies primarily in Africa and 
Asia; over 99% are attributable to bites from rabid dogs. 
Rabies is generally considered fatal with onset of clinical symptoms; the 
Milwaukee protocol can be attempted to rescue symptomatic humans but no 
treatment exists for animal species. 
Death generally occurs in most species within 10 days of clinical sign onset. 
Rabies is entirely vaccine preventable through vaccination; not only is 
pre-exposure vaccination effective, but due to the pathogenesis mechanism 
leading to a long (weeks to months) incubation period, post-exposure prophylaxis 
quickly after exposure is also effective in protecting against disease 
development.

Bats are a major wildlife reservoir for rabies in the Americas. 
Most human rabies cases in the United States are attributable to a bite from a 
rabid bat. 
Vampire bats in Central and South Americas are major transmitters of rabies, 
especially to livestock, because of their feeding habits: they bite their prey 
in order to lap up blood.

::: {.callout-note title="Fun fact"}
Bats generally tolerate most viruses without any clinical manifestations. 
Rabies is an exception - bats do get sick and die from rabies. 
However, though rabies is generally considered fatal, there are well-documented 
viral neutralizing antibodies in non-vaccinated bats, suggesting that some bats 
exposed to rabies will mount an immune response and survive.

### Nipah

Nipah virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe encephalitis with or 
without respiratory involvement and a reported fatality rate of up to 40-75%. 
Nipah virus was first recognized in Malaysia in 1998. 
The emergence of the virus demonstrates the complex interactions between people, 
animals, and the environment that characterizes One Health.
Fruit trees planted in close proximity to pig farms attracted a fruit-eating bat 
species, "Flying Foxes," the wildlife reservoir of Nipah. 
The leading belief about Nipah emergence is that fruit dropped by the Flying 
Foxes into the pig enclosures were subsequently eaten by the pigs accompanied 
with Nipah exposure and infection. 
Infectious pigs could then transmit to humans who came into contact causing an 
outbreak. 
There have been subsequent Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh, associated with date 
palm sap contaminated with Flying Fox saliva during the collection process.

### Hendra
Hendra virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause a range of clinical signs 
in humans and in horses from mild influenza-like syndromes to fatal respiratory 
and neurlogical disease. 
Similar to Nipah virus, Flying fox are the reservoir species for Hendra. 
Horses can become infected through exposure to Flying Fox bodily fluids, such as 
saliva on partially eaten fruit dropped into pastures. 
Though outbreaks have been rare, forward transmission to other horses and humans 
have been reported. 
The disease was first diagnosed in 1994.

### Coronaviruses 
Coronaviruses cause a range of diseases from common colds in humans to severe 
gastrointestinal disease in neonatal livestock. 
Coronaviruses are a large virus family that circulates in numerous animal 
opulations, including many bat species. 
Though bats generally are not affected clinically, spillover to other animals, 
ave historically caused catastrophic human epidemics. 
Three recent infamous coronavirus spillovers from bats into humans through an 
intermediary highlight the pandemic potential of these viruses: SARS, MERS, and 
COVID-19. All three of these syndromes are characterized by mild to severe 
respiratory disease. 

**SARS** (severe acute respiratory syndrome) emerged in 2002 in the Guangdong 
Province in China. 
Characterized by large super-spreading events, the virus (SARS-CoV-1) spread to 
29 countries and infected over 8000 people, killing over 900. 
(REF: Cherry, 2004. 10.1203/01.PDR.0000129184.87042.FC)
Scientific research identified horseshoe bats as the wildlife reservoir; spillover
to humans was mediated through the intermediary of palm civets from horseshoe bats.
(REF: Lau, 2005. 0.1073/pnas.0506735102)

::: {.callout-note title="Fun fact"}
Interestingly, SARS was last diagnosed in 2004, and has since disappeared, 
with no new cases being detected in the last 20 years, a feat only achieved 
on purpose for 2 viruses through enormous coordinated vaccination efforts.
:::

**MERS** (Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) was first recognized in Saudi 
Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV is suspected to spillover to humans from contact with 
camelids, with camelids originally acquiring the virus from bats. 
(REF Corman, 2014, 10.1128/JVI.01498-14). 
Characterized by a high death rate (34.3%), MERS has caused nearly 2.5 thousand
infections, largely in the Arabian penninsula.
MERS-CoV continues to cause sporadic cases and local outbreaks.
(REF: Memish, 2020, 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33221-0)

**COVID-19** (caused by SARS-CoV-2) origins are still under investigation, there is 
a body of evidence that spillover occurred from horseshoe bats to raccoon dogs 
then humans in a wet market in Wuhan, China. (REF Looi 2024, 10.1136/bmj.q1578)
Sustained human to human transmission expanded to a global scale by 2020 with the 
COVID-19 pandemic causing widespread infection and mortality.
