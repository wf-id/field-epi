# Defining a case

One of the key aspects of an outbreak investigation is establishing the case definition. 
A case definition describes a set of standardized criteria to determine if an individual should be counted in the outbreak under investigation. 
The key components of a case definition are who (the individual), where (location), when (time frame), and what (symptoms, diagnostics).
