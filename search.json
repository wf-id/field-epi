    "text": "2.1 Travel medicine clinic\nTravel medicine clinics are typically staffed by infectious disease physicians who can recommend different vaccines, prophylaxis, and counseling on what to do in case of emergencies. Visits to a travel medicine provider are typically covered by your insurance.\nThese providers will examine things like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s yellow book or other resources like Shoreland Travax. Based on the ongoing disease dynamics within the country, your will see three different categories for vaccination:\nWe can look at the CDC recommendations for Peru.\nRecommended vaccines for travelers to Peru retrieved from https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/peru on 2024-10-03\n\n\nVaccines for disease\nRecommendations\nClinical Guidance for Healthcare providers\n\n\n\n\nRoutine vaccines\nMake sure you are up-to-date on all routine vaccines before every trip. Some of these vaccines include Chickenpox (Varicella) Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Flu (influenza) Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Polio Shingles\nImmunization schedules\n\n\nCOVID-19\nAll eligible travelers should be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines. Please see Your COVID-19 Vaccination for more information.\nCOVID-19 vaccine\n\n\nChikungunya\nThere has been evidence of chikungunya virus transmission in Peru within the last 5 years. Chikungunya vaccination may be considered for the following travelers: People aged 65 years or older, especially those with underlying medical conditions, who may spend at least 2 weeks (cumulative time) in indoor or outdoor areas where mosquitoes are present in Peru, OR People planning to stay in Peru for a cumulative period of 6 months or more\nChikungunya - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nHepatitis A\nRecommended for unvaccinated travelers one year old or older going to Peru. Infants 6 to 11 months old should also be vaccinated against Hepatitis A. The dose does not count toward the routine 2-dose series. Travelers allergic to a vaccine component should receive a single dose of immune globulin, which provides effective protection for up to 2 months depending on dosage given. Unvaccinated travelers who are over 40 years old, are immunocompromised, or have chronic medical conditions planning to depart to a risk area in less than 2 weeks should get the initial dose of vaccine and at the same appointment receive immune globulin.\nHepatitis A - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Hep A\n\n\nHepatitis B\nRecommended for unvaccinated travelers younger than 60 years old traveling to Peru. Unvaccinated travelers 60 years and older may get vaccinated before traveling to Peru.\nHepatitis B - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Hep B\n\n\nMalaria\nCDC recommends that travelers going to certain areas of Peru take prescription medicine to prevent malaria. Depending on the medicine you take, you will need to start taking this medicine multiple days before your trip, as well as during and after your trip. Talk to your doctor about which malaria medication you should take. Find country-specific information about malaria.\nMalaria - CDC Yellow Book Considerations when choosing a drug for malaria prophylaxis (CDC Yellow Book) Malaria information for Peru.\n\n\nMeasles\nCases of measles are on the rise worldwide. Travelers are at risk of measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure, or have not had measles in the past, and travel internationally to areas where measles is spreading. All international travelers should be fully vaccinated against measles with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants 6–11 months, according to CDC’s measles vaccination recommendations for international travel.\nMeasles (Rubeola) - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nRabies\nDogs infected with rabies are sometimes found in Peru. Rabies is also commonly found in some terrestrial wildlife species and bats. If rabies exposures occur while in Peru, rabies vaccines may only be available in larger suburban/urban medical facilities. Rabies pre-exposure vaccination considerations include whether travelers 1) will be performing occupational or recreational activities that increase risk for exposure to potentially rabid animals and 2) might have difficulty getting prompt access to safe post-exposure prophylaxis. Please consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether you should receive pre-exposure vaccination before travel. For more information, see country rabies status assessments.\nRabies - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nTyphoid\nRecommended for most travelers, especially those staying with friends or relatives or visiting smaller cities or rural areas.\nTyphoid - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Typhoid\n\n\nYellow Fever\nRecommended for travelers ≥9 months old going to areas &lt;2,300 m (≈7,550 ft) elevation in the regions of Amazonas, Cusco, Huánuco, Junín, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Pasco, Puno, San Martín, and Ucayali, and designated areas of Ancash (far northeast), Apurímac (far north), Ayacucho (north and northeast), Cajamarca (north and east), Huancavelica (far north), La Libertad (east), and Piura (east). Generally not recommended for travel limited to the following areas west of the Andes: the regions of Lambayeque and Tumbes, and designated areas of Cajamarca (west-central), and Piura (west). Not recommended for travel limited to areas &gt;2,300 m (≈7,550 ft) elevation, areas west of the Andes not listed above, the city of Lima (the capital), and the highland tourist areas (the city of Cusco, the Inca Trail, and Machu Picchu).\nYellow Fever - CDC Yellow Book",

Additionally, you should make several copies of the identification page of your passport. It is important that you do not have both the copies and your physical passport on you at the same time when traveling. Having paper copies of your passport on you while in the field can prevent your actual passport from being stolen.\nVisas check with your embassy and relationship of your home country with the country you are visiting. For example, U.S. citizens visiting Peru can check the U.S. State Departments webpage. At the time of writing, you can stay without a visa for between 30 and 183 days. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is essential that you contact your embassy and discuss what is required in order to enter the country (e.g., for Peru you can see some of those nationals that might require an additional visa application).\nCopies of prescriptions for the medications that you are taking abroad.

    "text": "11.2 Infectious diseases\n\n11.2.1 Rabies\nRabies virus causes fatal neurological disease in all mammalian species. Transmitted through infectious saliva (generally through a bite from an infected animal), the virus is distributed in wildlife reservoirs globally. Approximately 59,000 humans die annually from rabies primarily in Africa and Asia; over 99% are attributable to bites from rabid dogs. Rabies is generally considered fatal with onset of clinical symptoms; the Milwaukee protocol can be attempted to rescue symptomatic humans but no treatment exists for animal species. Death generally occurs in most species within 10 days of clinical sign onset. Rabies is entirely vaccine preventable through vaccination; not only is pre-exposure vaccination effective, but due to the pathogenesis mechanism leading to a long (weeks to months) incubation period, post-exposure prophylaxis quickly after exposure is also effective in protecting against disease development.\nBats are a major wildlife reservoir for rabies in the Americas. Most human rabies cases in the United States are attributable to a bite from a rabid bat. Vampire bats in Central and South Americas are major transmitters of rabies, especially to livestock, because of their feeding habits: they bite their prey in order to lap up blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact\n\n\n\nBats generally tolerate most viruses without any clinical manifestations. Rabies is an exception - bats do get sick and die from rabies. However, though rabies is generally considered fatal, there are well-documented viral neutralizing antibodies in non-vaccinated bats, suggesting that some bats exposed to rabies will mount an immune response and survive.\n\n\nReferences\nWorld Health Organization \nDavis et al, 2012\n\n\n11.2.2 Nipah\nNipah virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe encephalitis with or without respiratory involvement and a reported fatality rate of up to 40%. Nipah virus was first recognized in Malaysia in 1998. The emergence of the virus demonstrates the complex interactions between people, animals, and the environment that characterizes One Health. Fruit trees planted in close proximity to pig farms attracted a fruit-eating bat species, “Flying Foxes,” the wildlife reservoir of Nipah. The leading belief about Nipah emergence is that fruit dropped by the Flying Foxes into the pig enclosures were subsequently eaten by the pigs accompanied with Nipah exposure and infection. Infectious pigs could then transmit to humans who came into contact causing an outbreak. There have been subsequent Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh, associated with date palm sap contaminated with Flying Fox saliva during the collection process.\n\n\n11.2.3 Hendra\n\n\n11.2.4 Coronaviruses (MERS, SARS, COVID)\n\n\n11.2.5 Ebola\n\n\n11.2.6 Marburg\n\n\n11.2.7 Histoplasma capsulatum",

    "text": "A note about outbreaks\nField epidemiology has an express purpose– stop the outbreak while preserving the most human life as possible. In this way field epidemiology and outbreak response is more of an exercise in engineering. Rigorous scientific approaches and knowns are applied with a clear goal. Research might be conducted, but it is secondary to the objective of stopping the outbreak."
