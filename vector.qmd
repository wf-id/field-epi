# Vectors and reservoirs

Many infectious diseases may be transmitted through a **vector.** 
A vector is an organism that acts as a carrier of an infectious agent between organisms of a different species (Wilson, 2017). 
Most commonly, vectors are arthropods, such as mosquitos or ticks. 
Vectors can serve as a purely mechanical transport between individuals or can serve as a necessary intermediate in the pathogens lifecycle.  

A **reservoir** is the environment in which a pathogen population in maintained and could include humans, animals, and the environment (CDC, 2012).
Many emerging pathogens have wildlife reservoirs, i.e. the pathogen circulates in a wild animal population normally with some risk of spillover to people. 
Pathogens that can be transmitted between vertebrate hosts and humans are considered **zoonoses.**
Zoonotic diseases are often (but not always) transmitted by a vector.
