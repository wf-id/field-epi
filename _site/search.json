Loss of personel to sickness and quarantine can disrupt ongoing outbreak response actions. Importantly, while supplies allow and until testing indicates otherwise, you should operate at higher levels of PPE. This may include the use of N-95 respirators with facial shields and gloves (i.e., mask, gowns, and glasses/goggles). Depending on the pathogen suspected and the transmission modality, higher levels of PPE may be required. For instance during outbreaks of Marburg and Ebola, higher levels of PPE are required including full protective suits, gloves, and PAPRs.",
