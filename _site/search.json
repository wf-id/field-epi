    "text": "2.1 Travel medicine clinic\nTravel medicine clinics are typically staffed by infectious disease physicians who can recommend different vaccines, prophylaxis, and counseling on what to do in case of emergencies. Visits to a travel medicine provider are typically covered by your insurance.\nThese providers will examine things like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s yellow book or other resources like Shoreland Travax. Based on the ongoing disease dynamics within the country, your will see three different categories for vaccination:\nWe can look at the CDC recommendations for Peru.\nWarning: package 'kableExtra' was built under R version 4.4.1\nRecommended vaccines for travelers to Peru retrieved from https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/peru on 2025-01-23\n\n\nVaccines for disease\nRecommendations\nClinical Guidance for Healthcare providers\n\n\n\n\nRoutine vaccines\nMake sure you are up-to-date on all routine vaccines before every trip. Some of these vaccines include Chickenpox (Varicella) Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Flu (influenza) Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Polio Shingles\nImmunization schedules\n\n\nCOVID-19\nAll eligible travelers should be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines. Please see Your COVID-19 Vaccination for more information.\nCOVID-19 vaccine\n\n\nChikungunya\nThere has been evidence of chikungunya virus transmission in Peru within the last 5 years. Chikungunya vaccination may be considered for the following travelers: People aged 65 years or older, especially those with underlying medical conditions, who may spend at least 2 weeks (cumulative time) in indoor or outdoor areas where mosquitoes are present in Peru, OR People planning to stay in Peru for a cumulative period of 6 months or more\nChikungunya - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nHepatitis A\nRecommended for unvaccinated travelers one year old or older going to Peru. Infants 6 to 11 months old should also be vaccinated against Hepatitis A. The dose does not count toward the routine 2-dose series. Travelers allergic to a vaccine component should receive a single dose of immune globulin, which provides effective protection for up to 2 months depending on dosage given. Unvaccinated travelers who are over 40 years old, are immunocompromised, or have chronic medical conditions planning to depart to a risk area in less than 2 weeks should get the initial dose of vaccine and at the same appointment receive immune globulin.\nHepatitis A - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Hep A\n\n\nHepatitis B\nRecommended for unvaccinated travelers younger than 60 years old traveling to Peru. Unvaccinated travelers 60 years and older may get vaccinated before traveling to Peru.\nHepatitis B - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Hep B\n\n\nMalaria\nCDC recommends that travelers going to certain areas of Peru take prescription medicine to prevent malaria. Depending on the medicine you take, you will need to start taking this medicine multiple days before your trip, as well as during and after your trip. Talk to your doctor about which malaria medication you should take. Find country-specific information about malaria.\nMalaria - CDC Yellow Book Considerations when choosing a drug for malaria prophylaxis (CDC Yellow Book) Malaria information for Peru.\n\n\nMeasles\nCases of measles are on the rise worldwide. Travelers are at risk of measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure, or have not had measles in the past, and travel internationally to areas where measles is spreading. All international travelers should be fully vaccinated against measles with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants 6–11 months, according to CDC’s measles vaccination recommendations for international travel.\nMeasles (Rubeola) - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nRabies\nDogs infected with rabies are sometimes found in Peru. Rabies is also commonly found in some terrestrial wildlife species and bats. If rabies exposures occur while in Peru, rabies vaccines may only be available in larger suburban/urban medical facilities. Rabies pre-exposure vaccination considerations include whether travelers 1) will be performing occupational or recreational activities that increase risk for exposure to potentially rabid animals and 2) might have difficulty getting prompt access to safe post-exposure prophylaxis. Please consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether you should receive pre-exposure vaccination before travel. For more information, see country rabies status assessments.\nRabies - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nTyphoid\nRecommended for most travelers, especially those staying with friends or relatives or visiting smaller cities or rural areas.\nTyphoid - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Typhoid\n\n\nYellow Fever\nRecommended for travelers ≥9 months old going to areas &lt;2,300 m (≈7,550 ft) elevation in the regions of Amazonas, Cusco, Huánuco, Junín, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Pasco, Puno, San Martín, and Ucayali, and designated areas of Ancash (far northeast), Apurímac (far north), Ayacucho (north and northeast), Cajamarca (north and east), Huancavelica (far north), La Libertad (east), and Piura (east). Generally not recommended for travel limited to the following areas west of the Andes: the regions of Lambayeque and Tumbes, and designated areas of Cajamarca (west-central), and Piura (west). Not recommended for travel limited to areas &gt;2,300 m (≈7,550 ft) elevation, areas west of the Andes not listed above, the city of Lima (the capital), and the highland tourist areas (the city of Cusco, the Inca Trail, and Machu Picchu).\nYellow Fever - CDC Yellow Book",

Additionally, you should make several copies of the identification page of your passport. It is important that you do not have both the copies and your physical passport on you at the same time when traveling. Having paper copies of your passport on you while in the field can prevent your actual passport from being stolen.\nVisas check with your embassy and relationship of your home country with the country you are visiting. For example, U.S. citizens visiting Peru can check the U.S. State Departments webpage. At the time of writing, you can stay without a visa for between 30 and 183 days. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is essential that you contact your embassy and discuss what is required in order to enter the country (e.g., for Peru you can see some of those nationals that might require an additional visa application).\nCopies of prescriptions for the medications that you are taking abroad.

    "section": "",
    "text": "7.1 Summarized WHO guidelines\nWHO Consenses statement\n1. Obligations of Governments and the International Community: Governments have a duty to prevent and respond to infectious disease outbreaks through improved health systems and public health activities and contribute to global surveillance and preparedness. These obligations extend beyond national borders, as infectious diseases can spread globally, and wealthier countries are have ethical obligations to assist poorer nations in enhancing their health capacities.\n2. Involving the Local Community: Community engagement is crucial for building trust and social order during an outbreak. A community-centered approach involves inclusiveness, openness, transparency, and accountability, and ensures diverse perspectives are considered, with the media playing a key role in providing accurate, timely information.\n3. Situations of Particular Vulnerability: Vulnerable individuals or groups face heightened risks during outbreaks, including difficulties accessing services, communication barriers, and the threat of stigmatization. Efforts should focus on addressing these challenges through targeted support, ensuring equitable access, and preventing discrimination or violence.\n4. Allocating Scarce Resources: During outbreaks, resource allocation decisions must balance utility (maximizing benefits) and equity (fair distribution), with special attention to vulnerable populations.\n5. Public Health Surveillance: Surveillance is critical for managing and preventing outbreaks, but it must be ethically managed to protect personal information and ensure transparency in its use. Ethical oversight should balance public health goals with individual rights and vulnerabilities.\n6. Restrictions on Freedom of Movement: Restrictions like quarantine or travel bans should only be imposed when scientifically justified, using the least restrictive methods possible, and with humane conditions and support for those affected. They must be applied equitably, with opportunities for due process and transparency.\n7. Obligations Related to Medical Interventions: Medical interventions during outbreaks must meet high standards, and individuals should have the right to refuse them, unless refusal poses significant public health risks. Any overridden refusals must be carefully justified, with due process and attention to individual and community impacts.\n8. Research during Infectious Disease Outbreaks: Research during outbreaks is essential to inform public health responses and evaluate interventions, but it must be ethically conducted, respecting participants’ rights and integrating with the broader outbreak response efforts. Ethical oversight, informed consent, local capacity-building, and transparent data sharing are critical to ensuring that research supports both immediate and long-term public health goals.\n9. Emergency Use of Unproven Interventions Outside of Research: Offering unproven interventions outside of clinical trials is ethically acceptable during emergencies when no proven treatments are available, but it requires ethical oversight, informed consent, and transparent data sharing. Such interventions should be administered cautiously, with careful consideration of risks, benefits, and resource allocation.\n10. Rapid Data Sharing: During infectious disease outbreaks, rapid data sharing is critical for understanding the disease, predicting its spread, and guiding public health responses. Ethical issues related to this include ensuring privacy, data confidentiality, and resolving disputes over data ownership, while supporting international cooperation for timely sharing.\n11. Long-Term Storage of Biological Specimens: The long-term storage of biological specimens offers valuable research opportunities but raises ethical concerns about confidentiality, informed consent, and community trust. Engaging local communities, ensuring proper governance, and implementing material transfer agreements are crucial for ethically managing the storage and sharing of biospecimens.\n12. Addressing Sex- and Gender-Based Differences: Sex and gender influence the course and outcome of infectious disease outbreaks, affecting susceptibility, health care access, and interventions. Public health responses should include sex- and gender-sensitive surveillance, reproductive health services, inclusive research strategies, and tailored communication to address differential risks and needs.\n13. Frontline Response Workers’ Rights and Obligations: Frontline workers during infectious disease outbreaks have the right to protection, fair remuneration, and access to healthcare for themselves and their families. In return, society has an obligation to minimize risks, ensure adequate support, and help workers reintegrate post-outbreak, while considering the equity of risk distribution and potential consequences for non-participation.\n14. Ethical Issues in Deploying Foreign Humanitarian Aid Workers: Foreign humanitarian aid organizations must coordinate with local officials, ensure that workers are adequately trained and informed, and provide necessary resources for safe and effective deployment. Aid workers also have ethical obligations to adhere to their roles, maintain infection control practices, and ensure the wellbeing of affected communities while considering the ethical challenges of working in crises.",

    "text": "Many infectious diseases may be transmitted through a vector. A vector is an organism that acts as a carrier of an infectious agent between organisms of a different species (Wilson, 2017). Most commonly, vectors are arthropods, such as mosquitos or ticks. Vectors can serve as a purely mechanical transport between individuals or can serve as a necessary intermediate in the pathogens lifecycle.\nA reservoir is the environment in which a pathogen population in maintained and could include humans, animals, and the environment (CDC, 2012). Many emerging pathogens have wildlife reservoirs, i.e. the pathogen circulates in a wild animal population normally with some risk of spillover to people. Pathogens that can be transmitted between vertebrate hosts and humans are considered zoonoses. Zoonotic diseases are often (but not always) transmitted by a vector.",

    "text": "Fun fact\n\n\n\nIn addition to being the only mammals that can truly fly, and the unique sensory adaptations for echolocation, bats have several remarkable features. They live longer life-spans (up to 40 years!) than other species of a similar size and have enormous metabolic rates during flight. Fascinatingly, they carry a wide-range of human transmissible viruses, but rarely are affected clinically themselves. The unique immune and metabolic features that allow them to tolerate viruses and have marked longevity is an area of active research.",

    "text": "11.2 Infectious diseases\n\n11.2.1 Rabies\nRabies virus causes fatal neurological disease in all mammalian species. Transmitted through infectious saliva (generally through a bite from an infected animal), the virus is distributed in wildlife reservoirs globally. Approximately 59,000 humans die annually from rabies primarily in Africa and Asia; over 99% are attributable to bites from rabid dogs. Rabies is generally considered fatal with onset of clinical symptoms; the Milwaukee protocol can be attempted to rescue symptomatic humans but no treatment exists for animal species. Death generally occurs in most species within 10 days of clinical sign onset. Rabies is entirely vaccine preventable through vaccination; not only is pre-exposure vaccination effective, but due to the pathogenesis mechanism leading to a long (weeks to months) incubation period, post-exposure prophylaxis quickly after exposure is also effective in protecting against disease development. (REF WHO, 2018, Technical report)\nBats are a major wildlife reservoir for rabies in the Americas. Most human rabies cases in the United States are attributable to a bite from a rabid bat. Vampire bats in Central and South Americas are major transmitters of rabies, especially to livestock, because of their feeding habits: they bite their prey in order to lap up blood. (REF WHO, 2018, Technical report)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact\n\n\n\nBats generally tolerate most viruses without any clinical manifestations. Rabies is an exception - bats do get sick and die from rabies. However, though rabies is generally considered fatal, there are well-documented viral neutralizing antibodies in non-vaccinated bats, suggesting that some bats exposed to rabies will mount an immune response and survive. (REF Davis, 2012, 10.1089/vbz.2011.0674)\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Nipah\nNipah virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe encephalitis with or without respiratory involvement and a reported fatality rate of up to 40-75%. Nipah virus was first recognized in Malaysia in 1998. The emergence of the virus demonstrates the complex interactions between people, animals, and the environment that characterizes One Health. Fruit trees planted in close proximity to pig farms attracted a fruit-eating bat species, “Flying Foxes,” the wildlife reservoir of Nipah. The leading belief about Nipah emergence is that fruit dropped by the Flying Foxes into the pig enclosures were subsequently eaten by the pigs accompanied with Nipah exposure and infection. Infectious pigs could then transmit to humans who came into contact causing an outbreak. There have been subsequent Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh, associated with date palm sap contaminated with Flying Fox saliva during the collection process. (REF Daszak, 2012, 10.1073/pnas.1201243109)\n\n\n11.2.3 Hendra\nHendra virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause a range of clinical signs in humans and in horses from mild influenza-like syndromes to fatal respiratory and neurlogical disease. Similar to Nipah virus, Flying fox are the reservoir species for Hendra. Horses can become infected through exposure to Flying Fox bodily fluids, such as saliva on partially eaten fruit dropped into pastures. Though outbreaks have been rare, forward transmission to other horses and humans have been reported. The disease was first diagnosed in 1994. (REF Field, 2001, 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01384-3)\n\n\n\n\n\nNipah and Hendra are both linked to Flying Fox bats dropping partially massicated fruit into animal enclosures. Photo credit: Johannes Giez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Coronaviruses\nCoronaviruses cause a range of diseases from common colds in humans to severe gastrointestinal disease in neonatal livestock. Coronaviruses are a large virus family that circulates in numerous animal opulations, including many bat species. Though bats generally are not affected clinically, spillover to other animals, ave historically caused catastrophic human epidemics. Three recent infamous coronavirus spillovers from bats into humans through an intermediary highlight the pandemic potential of these viruses: SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. All three of these syndromes are characterized by mild to severe respiratory disease.\nSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) emerged in 2002 in the Guangdong Province in China. Characterized by large super-spreading events, the virus (SARS-CoV-1) spread to 29 countries and infected over 8000 people, killing over 900. (REF: Cherry, 2004. 10.1203/01.PDR.0000129184.87042.FC) Scientific research identified horseshoe bats as the wildlife reservoir; spillover to humans was mediated through the intermediary of palm civets from horseshoe bats. (REF: Lau, 2005. 0.1073/pnas.0506735102)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact\n\n\n\nInterestingly, SARS was last diagnosed in 2004, and has since disappeared, with no new cases being detected in the last 20 years, a feat only achieved on purpose for 2 viruses through enormous coordinated vaccination efforts.\n\n\nMERS (Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) was first recognized in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV is suspected to spillover to humans from contact with camelids, with camelids originally acquiring the virus from bats. (REF Corman, 2014, 10.1128/JVI.01498-14). Characterized by a high death rate (34.3%), MERS has caused nearly 2.5 thousand infections, largely in the Arabian penninsula. MERS-CoV continues to cause sporadic cases and local outbreaks. (REF: Memish, 2020, 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33221-0)\nCOVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) origins are still under investigation, there is evidence that spillover occurred from horseshoe bats to raccoon dogs then humans in a wet market in Wuhan, China. (REF Looi 2024, 10.1136/bmj.q1578) Sustained human to human transmission expanded to a global scale by 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic causing widespread infection and mortality.\n\n\n11.2.5 Hemorrhagic fevers caused by filoviruses\nFiloviruses, the pathogen family responsible for both Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, are considered to primarily circulate among fruit bat reservoirs. Spillover to primates, including humans, can cause serious hemorrhagic fever.\nEbola was first recognized in the 1970’s with several outbreaks occuring in the succeeding decades. Notably, in 2014, a large outbreak in West Africa was declared a Public Health emergency of International Concern by the WHO. More than 28,600 people were infected during the outbreak with a case mortality rate approaching 40%. The mortality of Ebolavirus without treatment reaches 90%. (REF Kalra, 2014, 10.4103/0974-777X.145247; CDC, 2024, Outbreak History)\nMarburg virus disease presents clinically similar to Ebola with hemorrhagic fever and high case mortality (ranging from 24-88%). The disease was first recognized in Germany in the late 1960s. Rousettus bats are believed to be the main wildlife reservoir. (REF WHO, 2021, Factsheet)\n\n\n\n\n\nFiloviruses, including Ebolaviruses and Marburgviruses, have a distinctive filamentous struture. Pictured is an electron microscope image of an Ebolavirus. Photo credit: CDC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.6 Histoplasmosis\nHistoplasma capsulatum is a fungal pathogen that can be transmitted to humans and companion animals through inhalation of bat guano. Clinical manifestations include fever and respiratory disease.",

These nets are a very fine weave strung between two poles that is practically invisible to the eye and by echolocation. Used to capture both birds and bats, the animal flies into them and becomes entangled.

Utility prioritizes maximizing benefits, while equity focuses on fair distribution, sometimes favoring vulnerable groups.\n\nDefining utility on the basis of health-related considerations: Utility should focus on health-related outcomes such as lives saved or life years gained. Allocations should prioritize health benefits, not social value unrelated to outbreak management.\n\nPaying attention to the needs of vulnerable populations: Special attention should be given to vulnerable groups at higher risk of discrimination or isolation.\n\nFulfilling reciprocity-based obligations to those who contribute to outbreak response efforts: Society should support those taking risks in response efforts.

Qualified, unbiased clinicians should make allocation decisions.\n\n\nPublic health surveillance\n\n\nProtecting the confidentiality of personal information: Personal data collected during outbreaks must be protected to avoid exposing individuals to risks, with strict laws governing its use and sharing.\n\nAssessing the importance of universal participation: Mandatory surveillance is ethically justified for public health objectives, but opt-out options should be considered based on risks and goals.\n\nDisclosing information to individuals and communities: Surveillance should be transparent, informing individuals about data collection, usage, and potential sharing, with careful communication to avoid stigmatization.\n\n\nRestrictions on freedom of movement\n\n\n\nJustifiable basis for imposing restrictions: Decisions to impose movement restrictions should be based on evidence and continuously reassessed.\n\nLeast restrictive means: Restrictions should be the least restrictive possible, with stronger measures only when necessary to achieve health goals.\n\nCosts: While less restrictive alternatives may cost more, cost alone does not justify stricter measures.\n\nEnsuring humane conditions: Restrictions should provide sufficient resources to avoid undue burdens and respect individual dignity.\n\nAddressing financial and social consequences: Countries should support individuals and communities affected by movement restrictions.\n\nDue process protections: Mechanisms should be in place for individuals to challenge movement restrictions, ensuring accountability.\n\nEquitable application: Restrictions should apply equally to all, without discrimination based on social group or class.\n\nCommunication and transparency: Public health officials should engage communities and provide regular updates to minimize stigmatization.\n\n\nObligations related to medical interventions for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infectious disease\n\n\n\nPublic health necessity of the proposed intervention: Refusing an individual’s refusal should be based on significant public health risks, with no other feasible options available.\n\nExistence of medical contraindications to the proposed intervention: Individuals should not be forced into interventions that pose significant risks due to personal medical conditions.\n\nFeasibility of providing interventions to an unwilling patient: If unwilling, interventions may not be feasible, and isolation may be the only alternative for public health protection.\n\nImpact on community trust: Overriding refusal can damage trust in healthcare providers and the public health system, so benefits must outweigh potential harms.\n\n\nResearch during infectious disease outbreaks\n\n\nRole of local research institutions: Local researchers should be involved in outbreak-related research to address local needs, ensure effective implementation, and build long-term research capacity.\n\nAddressing limitations in local research ethics review and scientific capacity: Local research ethics reviews may be limited during outbreaks, and international organizations should assist to overcome these challenges.\n\nProviding ethics review in time-sensitive circumstances: Accelerated ethics review mechanisms should be developed for emergency situations, without compromising protections, including reviewing generic protocols for outbreaks.\n\nIntegrating research into broader outbreak response efforts: Research should be coordinated with outbreak efforts to avoid duplication, with shared information crucial for response and confidentiality protected.\n\nEnsuring that research does not drain critical health-related resources: Research should not excessively divert resources from critical health efforts and should focus on local capacity-building.\n\nConfronting fear and desperation: The climate of fear during outbreaks can impair objective assessment of research, and interventions should be based on scientific evidence of efficacy and safety.\n\nAddressing other barriers to informed consent: Fear, cultural differences, and isolation can impede informed consent, so processes should be culturally appropriate and informed by local support systems.\n\nGaining and maintaining trust: Community trust is essential for research success and should be maintained throughout the study; transparency and independence from government involvement are crucial.\n\nSelecting an appropriate research methodology: Research must be methodologically rigorous to ensure valid results, considering both scientific validity and acceptability to the community.\n\nRapid data sharing: Researchers must share preliminary results quickly with public health officials, participants, and the wider response effort, without waiting for publication in journals.\n\nAssuring equitable access to the benefits of research: Research participants and local communities should have access to the benefits of successful interventions, with mechanisms in place to ensure timely availability.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The CDC Field Epidemiology Manual outlines 10 steps of a field investigation for an outbreak.\nSource: Field Epi Manual\nStep 1: Prepare for Field Work\nBefore beginning a field investigation, ensure all involved parties understand the purpose, roles, and responsibilities. Obtain necessary official approvals, including a formal invitation from an authorized official, and consult with laboratory colleagues about testing and safety protocols.\nStep 2: Confirm the Diagnosis\nVerification of the diagnosis ensures that the issue is properly identified and not a misdiagnosis. This can be achieved through interviews, clinical exams, medical records, and laboratory tests, and specimens should be preserved for later analysis.\nStep 3: Determine the Existence of an Outbreak\nDetermine if an outbreak exists by comparing the number of cases to expected numbers, using historical data or surveillance records. This helps rule out pseudoepidemics caused by misdiagnosis or reporting issues.\nStep 4: Identify and Count Cases\nCreate a clear case definition and systematically search for all cases of the disease without including non-cases. This involves classifying cases based on symptoms, timing, and exposure settings and compiling the data into a structured format for analysis.\nStep 5: Tabulate and Orient the Data in Terms of Time, Place, and Person\nOrganize the collected data into an epidemiologic description that focuses on time, place, and person. This includes creating epidemic curves, spot maps, and comparing groups to form initial hypotheses about the outbreak’s cause and spread.\nStep 6: Consider Whether Control Measures can be Implemented Now\nControl measures can target either the source of the disease or susceptible individuals through interventions like treatment, isolation, vaccination, or prophylaxis. While typically implemented after confirming hypotheses, preliminary control measures can be initiated based on early information to prevent further spread.\nStep 7: Develop and Test Hypotheses\nDevelop hypotheses about the cause, source, and mode of transmission of the outbreak based on various sources, including descriptive epidemiology and interviews. Testing these hypotheses through analytic studies like cohort or case-control studies helps confirm risk factors and causal associations.\nStep 9: Implement and Evaluate Control and Prevention Measures\nThe goal of an investigation is to implement and evaluate effective control measures to prevent further morbidity or mortality. Ongoing evaluation, including active surveillance, helps assess the effectiveness of these measures and guides necessary adjustments.\nStep 10: Communicate Findings\nEffective communication is essential throughout and after an outbreak investigation. Establishing a clear communications plan and a designated spokesperson ensures consistency in sharing findings with the public, stakeholders, and other relevant authorities, including through briefings and written reports.",
