    "text": "2.1 Travel medicine clinic\nTravel medicine clinics are typically staffed by infectious disease physicians who can recommend different vaccines, prophylaxis, and counseling on what to do in case of emergencies. Visits to a travel medicine provider are typically covered by your insurance.\nThese providers will examine things like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s yellow book or other resources like Shoreland Travax. Based on the ongoing disease dynamics within the country, your will see three different categories for vaccination:\nWe can look at the CDC recommendations for Peru.\nRecommended vaccines for travelers to Peru retrieved from https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/peru on 2024-07-07\n\n\nVaccines for disease\nRecommendations\nClinical Guidance for Healthcare providers\n\n\n\n\nRoutine vaccines\nMake sure you are up-to-date on all routine vaccines before every trip. Some of these vaccines include Chickenpox (Varicella) Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Flu (influenza) Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Polio Shingles\nImmunization schedules\n\n\nCOVID-19\nAll eligible travelers should be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines. Please see Your COVID-19 Vaccination for more information.\nCOVID-19 vaccine\n\n\nChikungunya\nThere has been evidence of chikungunya virus transmission in Peru within the last 5 years. Chikungunya vaccination may be considered for the following travelers: People aged 65 years or older, especially those with underlying medical conditions, who may spend at least 2 weeks (cumulative time) in indoor or outdoor areas where mosquitoes are present in Peru, OR People planning to stay in Peru for a cumulative period of 6 months or more\nChikungunya - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nHepatitis A\nRecommended for unvaccinated travelers one year old or older going to Peru. Infants 6 to 11 months old should also be vaccinated against Hepatitis A. The dose does not count toward the routine 2-dose series. Travelers allergic to a vaccine component or who are younger than 6 months should receive a single dose of immune globulin, which provides effective protection for up to 2 months depending on dosage given. Unvaccinated travelers who are over 40 years old, immunocompromised, or have chronic medical conditions planning to depart to a risk area in less than 2 weeks should get the initial dose of vaccine and at the same appointment receive immune globulin.\nHepatitis A - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Hep A\n\n\nHepatitis B\nRecommended for unvaccinated travelers younger than 60 years old traveling to Peru. Unvaccinated travelers 60 years and older may get vaccinated before traveling to Peru.\nHepatitis B - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Hep B\n\n\nMalaria\nCDC recommends that travelers going to certain areas of Peru take prescription medicine to prevent malaria. Depending on the medicine you take, you will need to start taking this medicine multiple days before your trip, as well as during and after your trip. Talk to your doctor about which malaria medication you should take. Find country-specific information about malaria.\nMalaria - CDC Yellow Book Considerations when choosing a drug for malaria prophylaxis (CDC Yellow Book) Malaria information for Peru.\n\n\nMeasles\nCases of measles are on the rise worldwide. Travelers are at risk of measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure, or have not had measles in the past, and travel internationally to areas where measles is spreading. All international travelers should be fully vaccinated against measles with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants 6–11 months, according to CDC’s measles vaccination recommendations for international travel.\nMeasles (Rubeola) - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nRabies\nDogs infected with rabies are sometimes found in Peru. Rabies is also commonly found in some terrestrial wildlife species and bats. If rabies exposures occur while in Peru, rabies vaccines may only be available in larger suburban/urban medical facilities. Rabies pre-exposure vaccination considerations include whether travelers 1) will be performing occupational or recreational activities that increase risk for exposure to potentially rabid animals and 2) might have difficulty getting prompt access to safe post-exposure prophylaxis. Please consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether you should receive pre-exposure vaccination before travel. For more information, see country rabies status assessments.\nRabies - CDC Yellow Book\n\n\nTyphoid\nRecommended for most travelers, especially those staying with friends or relatives or visiting smaller cities or rural areas.\nTyphoid - CDC Yellow Book Dosing info - Typhoid\n\n\nYellow Fever\nRecommended for travelers ≥9 months old going to areas &lt;2,300 m (≈7,550 ft) elevation in the regions of Amazonas, Cusco, Huánuco, Junín, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Pasco, Puno, San Martín, and Ucayali, and designated areas of Ancash (far northeast), Apurímac (far north), Ayacucho (north and northeast), Cajamarca (north and east), Huancavelica (far north), La Libertad (east), and Piura (east). Generally not recommended for travel limited to the following areas west of the Andes: the regions of Lambayeque and Tumbes, and designated areas of Cajamarca (west-central), and Piura (west). Not recommended for travel limited to areas &gt;2,300 m (≈7,550 ft) elevation, areas west of the Andes not listed above, the city of Lima (the capital), and the highland tourist areas (the city of Cusco, the Inca Trail, and Machu Picchu).\nYellow Fever - CDC Yellow Book",

For example, U.S. citizens visiting Peru can check the U.S. State Departments webpage. At the time of writing, you can stay without a visa for between 30 and 183 days. If you are not a U.S. citizen, it is essential that you contact your embassy and discuss what is required in order to enter the country (e.g., for Peru you can see some of those nationals that might require an additional visa application).\nCopies of prescriptions for the medications that you are taking abroad.

    "text": "11.2 Infectious diseases\n\n11.2.1 Rabies\nRabies virus causes fatal neurological disease in all mammalian species. Transmitted through infectious saliva (generally through a bite from an infected animal), the virus is distributed in wildlife reservoirs globally. Approximately 59,000 humans die annually from rabies primarily in Africa and Asia; over 99% are attributable to bites from rabid dogs. Rabies is generally considered fatal with onset of clinical symptoms; the Milwaukee protocol can be attempted to rescue symptomatic humans but no treatment exists for animal species. Death generally occurs in most species within 10 days of clinical sign onset. Rabies is entirely vaccine preventable through vaccination; not only is pre-exposure vaccination effective, but due to the pathogenesis mechanism leading to a long (weeks to months) incubation period, post-exposure prophylaxis quickly after exposure is also effective in protecting against disease development. (REF WHO, 2018, Technical report)\nBats are a major wildlife reservoir for rabies in the Americas. Most human rabies cases in the United States are attributable to a bite from a rabid bat. Vampire bats in Central and South Americas are major transmitters of rabies, especially to livestock, because of their feeding habits: they bite their prey in order to lap up blood. (REF WHO, 2018, Technical report)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact\n\n\n\nBats generally tolerate most viruses without any clinical manifestations. Rabies is an exception - bats do get sick and die from rabies. However, though rabies is generally considered fatal, there are well-documented viral neutralizing antibodies in non-vaccinated bats, suggesting that some bats exposed to rabies will mount an immune response and survive. (REF Davis, 2012, 10.1089/vbz.2011.0674)\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Nipah\nNipah virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe encephalitis with or without respiratory involvement and a reported fatality rate of up to 40-75%. Nipah virus was first recognized in Malaysia in 1998. The emergence of the virus demonstrates the complex interactions between people, animals, and the environment that characterizes One Health. Fruit trees planted in close proximity to pig farms attracted a fruit-eating bat species, “Flying Foxes,” the wildlife reservoir of Nipah. The leading belief about Nipah emergence is that fruit dropped by the Flying Foxes into the pig enclosures were subsequently eaten by the pigs accompanied with Nipah exposure and infection. Infectious pigs could then transmit to humans who came into contact causing an outbreak. There have been subsequent Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh, associated with date palm sap contaminated with Flying Fox saliva during the collection process. (REF Daszak, 2012, 10.1073/pnas.1201243109)\n\n\n11.2.3 Hendra\nHendra virus is an emerging pathogen that can cause a range of clinical signs in humans and in horses from mild influenza-like syndromes to fatal respiratory and neurlogical disease. Similar to Nipah virus, Flying fox are the reservoir species for Hendra. Horses can become infected through exposure to Flying Fox bodily fluids, such as saliva on partially eaten fruit dropped into pastures. Though outbreaks have been rare, forward transmission to other horses and humans have been reported. The disease was first diagnosed in 1994. (REF Field, 2001, 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01384-3)\n\n\n\n\n\nNipah and Hendra are both linked to Flying Fox bats dropping partially massicated fruit into animal enclosures.

Coronaviruses are a large virus family that circulates in numerous animal opulations, including many bat species. Though bats generally are not affected clinically, spillover to other animals, ave historically caused catastrophic human epidemics. Three recent infamous coronavirus spillovers from bats into humans through an intermediary highlight the pandemic potential of these viruses: SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. All three of these syndromes are characterized by mild to severe respiratory disease.\nSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) emerged in 2002 in the Guangdong Province in China. Characterized by large super-spreading events, the virus (SARS-CoV-1) spread to 29 countries and infected over 8000 people, killing over 900. (REF: Cherry, 2004. 10.1203/01.PDR.0000129184.87042.FC) Scientific research identified horseshoe bats as the wildlife reservoir; spillover to humans was mediated through the intermediary of palm civets from horseshoe bats. (REF: Lau, 2005. 0.1073/pnas.0506735102)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun fact\n\n\n\nInterestingly, SARS was last diagnosed in 2004, and has since disappeared, with no new cases being detected in the last 20 years, a feat only achieved on purpose for 2 viruses through enormous coordinated vaccination efforts.\n\n\nMERS (Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) was first recognized in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV is suspected to spillover to humans from contact with camelids, with camelids originally acquiring the virus from bats. (REF Corman, 2014, 10.1128/JVI.01498-14). Characterized by a high death rate (34.3%), MERS has caused nearly 2.5 thousand infections, largely in the Arabian penninsula. MERS-CoV continues to cause sporadic cases and local outbreaks. (REF: Memish, 2020, 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33221-0)\nCOVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) origins are still under investigation, there is evidence that spillover occurred from horseshoe bats to raccoon dogs then humans in a wet market in Wuhan, China. (REF Looi 2024, 10.1136/bmj.q1578) Sustained human to human transmission expanded to a global scale by 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic causing widespread infection and mortality.\n\n\n11.2.5 Hemorrhagic fevers caused by filoviruses\nFiloviruses, the pathogen family responsible for both Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, are considered to primarily circulate among fruit bat reservoirs. Spillover to primates, including humans, can cause serious hemorrhagic fever.\nEbola was first recognized in the 1970’s with several outbreaks occuring in the succeeding decades. Notably, in 2014, a large outbreak in West Africa was declared a Public Health emergency of International Concern by the WHO. More than 28,600 people were infected during the outbreak with a case mortality rate approaching 40%. The mortality of Ebolavirus without treatment reaches 90%. (REF Kalra, 2014, 10.4103/0974-777X.145247; CDC, 2024, Outbreak History)\nMarburg virus disease presents clinically similar to Ebola with hemorrhagic fever and high case mortality (ranging from 24-88%). The disease was first recognized in Germany in the late 1960s. Rousettus bats are believed to be the main wildlife reservoir. (REF WHO, 2021, Factsheet)\n\n\n\n\n\nFiloviruses, including Ebolaviruses and Marburgviruses, have a distinctive filamentous struture. Pictured is an electron microscope image of an Ebolavirus.

Clinical manifestations include fever and respiratory disease.",

These nets are a very fine weave strung between two poles that is practically invisible to the eye and by echolocation. Used to capture both birds and bats, the animal flies into them and becomes entangled.
