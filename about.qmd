## A note about outbreaks

Field epidemiology has an express purpose-- stop the outbreak while preserving the most human life as possible.
In this way field epidemiology and outbreak response is more of an exercise in *engineering*.
Rigorous scientific approaches and knowns are applied with a clear goal.
*Research* might be conducted, but it is secondary to the objective of stopping the outbreak.
